# Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ„âœ¨
This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a series of coding challenges that take place every December. Each year, I challenge myself to solve the puzzles in a different programming language to explore and learn new skills.

| Year | Language | Progress |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| [2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) | Python | 3/25 |
| [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) | Zig | 1/25 |
| [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) | Rust | 1/25 |

#### ðŸš€ Iâ€™ll be adding solutions from previous years of Advent of Code soon!
